"""
I built this million agent bc it has a million context window. The current problem with AI is the context window. 
Gemini just destroyed that problem and released Gemini Flash 2.0 with a million context window. 
This agent is a simple LLM where you can ask back and forth questions based off your knowledge-base 
Set up a knowledge base in the data folder called million_agent.
